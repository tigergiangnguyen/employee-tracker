# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker

## Description

In this assignment, I was assigned to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. In my application, I am using a "dotenv" package to hide MySQL username and password using a ".env" file. I did not do the bonus functionality as you will see only the ability to the acceptance criteria. This was also a good practice to link MySQL and Inquirer to see how it will run. This application is very useful to manage a company's employees and can be push further like seeing each department's hours worked, paychecks, revenue, etc. just by adding more tables.

## User Story

```md
AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role
WHEN I choose to view all departments
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids
WHEN I choose to view all roles
THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
WHEN I choose to view all employees
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to
WHEN I choose to add a department
THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database
WHEN I choose to add a role
THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database
WHEN I choose to add an employee
THEN I am prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database
WHEN I choose to update an employee role
THEN I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database 
```
